### R Package for Sample Design, Drawing, & Data Analysis Using Data Frames
The sampler R package is designed to enable data scientists to design, draw, and analyze simple or complex samples using data frames. It enables you to load machine-readable files (e.g. .csv, .tsv, etc.) in R containing a sampling frame or collected data, store them as objects, and perform sampling techniques and analysis using clear and concise methods. 

Specifically, a data scientist can use the sampler R package to: 

* determine simple random sample sizes, stratified sample sizes, and complex stratified sample sizes using a secondary variable such as population 
* draw simple random samples and stratified random samples from sampling data frames 
* determine which observations are missing from a random sample, missing by strata, duplicated within a dataset 
* perform data analysis, including proportions, margins of error and upper and lower bounds for simple, stratified and cluster sample designs 

The sampler R package builds a bridge for survey administrators between the free and open-source R environment and no-to-low cost [Open Data Kit (ODK)](https://opendatakit.org/)-based toolkits such as [Ona](https://ona.io/home/) and [NEMO](http://getnemo.org/). The sampler package is available via [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sampler) or GitHub for use in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/).  

### To install in R from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("sampler")
library(sampler)
```

### To install in R from GitHub:

```r
install.packages("devtools"); library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("mbaldassaro/sampler"); library(sampler)
```

The sampler R package includes the following datasets:

* ```albania```: dataset containing 2017 Albania election results by polling station published by the Central Election Commission and opened by the Coalition of Domestic Observers & Democracy International
* ```opening```: dataset containing 2017 Albania election observation findings on polling station opening process by the Coalition of Domestic Observers (CDO) CDO conducted a statistically-based observation (SBO) exercise, deploying observers to a random sample of polling stations for the 25 June 2017 Albanian elections. This is a subset of observation data collected by CDO observers that includes data that was used to perform statistical analysis

Full documentation of datasets and functions can be found on [RDocumentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/sampler)
